## üå± How to start this project?

Do not clone this repository because we are going to use a different template.

We recommend opening the project using [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local computer using `git clone`.

This is the base repository you need to use:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/flask-rest-hello
```

> ‚ö† You will need to have Python installed if you are working locally, but everything is preconfigured in Codespaces or Gitpod.
